/*
  This example sketch will walk you through how to tune the resonance frequency
  of the antenna using the IC's internal tuning caps. You'll need a logic analyzer, 
  oscillscope, or some method of reading a square wave of at least 4kHz but up to 32kHz.
  A note on what you can expect from a board fresh from SparkFun.
  The resonance frequency of a freshly manufactured SparkFun AS3935 Lightning
  Detectorw has been ~496kHz which is less then one percent deviation from
  perfect resonance. This falls well within the optimal value of 3.5 percent
  suggested in the datasheet on page 35. Again, 3.5 percent is OPTIMAL so try
  not to tear your hair out if it's not perfect.

  // The frequency of the antenna is divided by the "division ratio" which is
  // set to 16 by default. This can be changed to 32, 64, or 128 using the 
  // function call below. As an example when reading the frequency of a 
  // new board, the frequency 31.04kHz. Multiplying that frequency by the
  // division ratio gives 496.64kHz, which is less than 1 percent within the
  // OPTIMAL range of 3.5 percent specified in the datasheet.

  // somewhat modest. At the maximum value you can lower the frequency up to 22kHz. 
  // As a starting point, the products designed in house ship around 496kHz
  // (though of course every board is different) putting you within one percent
  // of a perfect resonance; the datasheet specifies being within 3.5 percent as

  // This will tell the IC to display the resonance frequncy as a digital
  // signal on the interrupt pin. There are two other internal oscillators 
  // within the chip that can also be displayed on this line but is outside the
  // scope of this example, see page 35 of the datsheet for more information.
