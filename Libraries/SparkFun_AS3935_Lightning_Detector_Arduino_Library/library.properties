The library gives you the ability to read lightning, get an estimate on its' distance, check its' 'energy', but also to reject noise and false lightning events. It also provides functions to tune the resonance frequency of the antenna! The entirety of the library's functions are demonstrated in the provided example code, making it easy to understand and follow along!
